# README-generator

## Description
This project is a readme file generator for my class assignment at UCF bootcamp full stack coding course. Normally this would be about another project that was created, but this readme is the project in itself. The assignment is designed to help a new developer to understand how to make a readme file. The developer will understand the importance of the purpose and function is for. This readme file is an example and should be completed for every project because that is what sets up a good project versus a bad project, The user should give in great detail on how they created the project the readme discusses so that other developers can understand what is being written in the original developers code.
